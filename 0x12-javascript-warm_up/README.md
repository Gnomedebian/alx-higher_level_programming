JavaScript is a scripting language that enables the creation of dynamic content on web pages. As a client-side language, it runs in web browsers, allowing developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) dynamically. This capability enables the creation of interactive and responsive user interfaces.

JavaScript is an essential part of the modern web stack, often used alongside HTML and CSS. It supports various programming paradigms, including object-oriented and functional programming. Its versatility extends beyond the browser, with the advent of server-side frameworks like Node.js, enabling developers to use JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development.

JavaScript is continuously evolving, with regular updates and improvements. Its widespread use and community support make it a fundamental language for web development, playing a crucial role in creating engaging and dynamic online experiences.
